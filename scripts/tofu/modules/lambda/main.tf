// Minimal stub module for Lambda used by the example live stack.
// This module intentionally doesn't create real AWS resources. It's a placeholder
// so `init` and module download steps succeed when the full module isn't
// present in the repository.

// No resources here on purpose. Consumers should replace this with a real
// implementation if they want to deploy a Lambda function.
